The HyperRecord test suite is spread out across a number of different files
in the test/ and spec/ directories.

$ ls -l test/
total 28
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   188 May 20 15:36 test_helper.rb
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 22281 May 30 13:56 thrift_client_test.rb

$ ls -l spec/
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 May 20 15:36 fixtures
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 May 30 14:08 lib
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4067 May 20 15:36 spec_helper.rb

The test/ directory contains unit tests (using Ruby's standard Test::Unit
library) that exercise the Thrift client libraries only.  These tests do
not cover any functionality specific to HyperRecord.

To run the Thrift client unit tests:
$ rake
<snip test output>

Failures in the test/ suite may be caused by:

1. A mismatch between the version of Thrift installed on your local machine
   and the version of Thrift supported in this release on HyperRecord.
2. Problems communicating with a ThriftBroker process running on the default
   port (38080) on localhost.  Note: you must be running Hypertable for
   these tests to pass and, specifically, a ThriftBroker process must be
   running on localhost.

The spec/ directory contains rspec tests that cover HyperRecord functionality.
Since HyperRecord extends the base ActiveRecord implementation, these tests 
can only be run if the HyperRecord gem directory has been unpacked into a
local Rails tree.  This is typically done by:

$ gem install hyper_record
$ cd vendor/gems
$ gem unpack hyper_recrd
$ gem uninstall hyper_record

To run the HyperRecord rspec tests:
$ rake spec
<snip test output>
